# Real-Time Helmet Detection using YOLOv8

This project implements a real-time helmet detection system for traffic monitoring, using the YOLOv8 object detection model. It identifies whether motorbike riders are wearing helmets from images or live video streams. Built with Python, OpenCV, Ultralytics YOLOv8, and Streamlit for GUI. Dataset sourced from Roboflow.
